Hackathons are a great way for students and aspiring developers to gain hands-on experience and make connections. 

## Why Hackathons

- **Learn by doing:** Build real projects and get your hands dirty with code in a short 36-54 hour timeframe. Learning through practice speeds up the learning process.

- **Collaborate & network:** Form teams or connect with other developers. Brainstorm ideas, divide up tasks, run into issues, fix bugs together. Plus interact with company reps and recruiters.

- **Create portfolio projects:** Have an actual app or website by the end to showcase your skills. Polish up the code later to highlight on your resume.

- **Free stuff:** Most hackathons provide food, swag and prizes for free just for participating!

## Tips

- Focus more on finishing projects rather than just starting many ideas. Completed apps stand out more.

- Make sure to present your hack to the judges to get feedback. Practice the demo and prepare to talk about the technology used.

- Take care to form teams wisely if going solo. Shared motivation levels affect outcome. 

- Leverage boilerplates/templates to maximize coding time. Don't get stuck on reinventing the wheel.

In summary, hackathons let you learn hands-on at a rapid pace while allowing you to expand your network. Highly recommended for students looking to build both hard and soft skills.
