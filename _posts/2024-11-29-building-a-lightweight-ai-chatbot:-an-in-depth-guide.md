Project Overview:
Introducing an AI Chatbot project that utilizes machine learning and natural language processing to understand and respond to human input. The chatbot is designed to facilitate customer service, answer FAQs, and provide real-time assistance on websites and applications.

Technical Specifications:
The chatbot is built using Python, leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow for machine learning, and NLTK for natural language processing. It uses a Seq2Seq model for generating responses and a Flask web server for deployment.

Implementation Details:
The chatbot project is divided into three main sections: data handling, model training, and deployment. Data handling involves cleaning and processing the textual data. The training phase involves teaching the model to generate appropriate responses. Deployment includes integrating the chatbot into a web server.

Code Snippets with Comments:

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import nltk
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

# Tokenizing and lemmatizing the input
def clean_up_sentence(sentence):
    sentence_words = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
    sentence_words = 
    return sentence_words
```

Setup/Usage Instructions:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the script using python3 chatbot.py
4. Access the chatbot on localhost:5000 in your web browser.
