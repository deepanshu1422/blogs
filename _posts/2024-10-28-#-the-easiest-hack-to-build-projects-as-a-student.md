The easiest hack to building projects as a student and as a computer science person is to go to hackathons, just go to hackathons, make a team or find people there, build a nice project in the first 36-54 hours and then present it in front of the judges.
**Benefits**:
- Get free food
- Get free goodies
- Talk and network with lots of recruiters and company representatives
So again, it's a win-win situation, it's free most of the times and USA and Canada especially have a lot of hackathons going on, so definitely go and attend.
